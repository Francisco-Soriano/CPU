# Multi-Cycle CPU Implementation
This project involves implementing a multi-cycle CPU using Verilog. The CPU is designed to handle key operations, including arithmetic, memory access, and control-related instructions, providing hands-on experience in building a foundational component of modern computer systems.

# Features
- Multi-cycle CPU architecture
- Supports arithmetic, memory, and control instructions
- Written in Verilog for hardware-level simulation and design

# Goals
By completing this project, you'll:
- Gain experience in CPU design and architecture
- Understand the implementation of multi-cycle processing
- Learn how core components of computer systems function
